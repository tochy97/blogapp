                    <Card.Text>My name is Tochukwu Egeonu, or Tochy for short. I am a University of Texas at Arlington graduate of 2022, with my bachelorâ€™s in computer science. I am originally from Nigeria, but I have lived in the US since the age of three. I was raised in the DFW area, specifically Grand Prairie, Texas. I spend my free time creating/updating little projects such as this one. If you like the look and feel of this site and want one of your own, feel free to contact me for a consultation. Feel free to check out my links below.</Card.Text>
